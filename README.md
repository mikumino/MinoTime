# MinoTime

A program for streamlining immersion tracking with Toggl Track

---

## What is MinoTime?

MinoTime is an **in-progress** program for tracking immersion hours and getting neat data and cool numbers by using Toggl Track’s API. This was originally made to generate daily immersion logs for me to send in a Discord accountability channel (though as of 11 May 2023 that is still the only feature lol).

## Installation

You will need to have Python installed. You can download Python 3 from the official website at **[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**.

In addition, you will need to install the PyQt5 library and any other required dependencies. You can install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed Python and the required dependencies, you can run the project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python [main.py](http://main.py/)
```

Right now, the API log in screen doesn’t actually take in anything, the token is just read from a token.json file that needs to be created by the user. :P
